# Pharmacographer — project guide for Claude Code

Interactive, **educational** pharmacokinetics (PK) curve plotter. The product is
**epistemic honesty**, not a prettier chart. Read
`PHARMACOGRAPHER_HANDOFF.md` for the full plan; this file is the working
conventions and the things that are easy to get wrong.

## The bright line (non-negotiable)

**Educational, never clinical.** Never build a feature that takes individual
patient data (real weight, renal/hepatic function, age, genetics) and returns a
dose or a clinical decision. Plotting an illustrative curve for a dose the user
picked is education; returning "give this patient X mg" is a medical device — do
not build it, however it is requested. The persistent `DisclaimerBanner` stays
wired in and non-dismissible.

## Architecture — three layers, hard boundaries (handoff §4)

```
engine/  pure PK math. NO React, NO DOM, NO data/JSON imports, NO I/O.
data/    one JSON file per compound + Zod schema + loader + derivation layer.
ui/      React components. The only layer that imports data and engine.
```

- The **engine is pure**: parameters + schedule in → concentration array out. It
  knows nothing about drugs, files, or pixels. `tsconfig.app.json` sets
  `types: []` and `eslint.config.js` strips globals under `src/engine/**` to
  enforce this — keep it that way.
- Dependencies point **upward only**: ui → data → engine. Never the reverse.

## Units — convert only at the edges (handoff §6)

One canonical internal system: **mg, L, mg/L, h, 1/h, L/h, mg/h**. All conversion
factors live in `src/engine/units.ts` — never scatter literals. Vd from sources
is usually L/kg; scale to absolute L with the **70 kg illustrative reference
subject** (`REFERENCE_WEIGHT_KG`). That subject is an educational assumption, not
a patient weight — never frame it otherwise.

## Data + provenance rules (handoff §3, §8)

- Every numeric parameter carries `value` (+ optional `range`) `+ unit + derived
(bool) + sourceRef + conditions`. `sourceRef` must resolve to a key in
  `sources` (or a sentinel like `definition` / `derived_from_tmax`).
- `derived: true` → the UI marks that value computed. Unavailable route → UI
  marks the line "inferred, not measured". Never invent a citation.
- `linear: false` compounds (nonlinear PK: phenytoin, ethanol, high-dose
  salicylate) are **excluded from v1** — superposition is invalid for them.
- Prefer FDA Structured Product Labels (public domain, openFDA). Don't lift
  curated tables wholesale; re-derive from primary sources. Record curator
  reasoning in the compound's `notes`. See `docs/DATA_GUIDE.md`.

## Testing (handoff §10)

Engine correctness is proven against **closed-form analytic answers**, not golden
snapshots: e.g. IV bolus `C(0)=D/Vd`, `C(t½)=C(0)/2`; numeric AUC ≈ `D/(Vd·ke)`;
flip-flop `ka≈ke` branch returns finite values; superposition of one dose equals
the single-dose curve. Numeric AUC via trapezoid on a fine grid, assert within a
small relative tolerance. Write the test before/with the math and make it pass.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev            # dev server
npm test               # vitest run (engine oracle tests)
npm run test:watch     # vitest watch
npm run build          # tsc -b + vite build (typecheck gate)
npm run lint           # eslint
npm run format         # prettier --write
```

Before committing a change: `npm test`, `npm run lint`, `npm run build` should
all pass.

## Conventions

- Tests import from `vitest` explicitly (globals are off).
- Data files are **JSON**, validated at load with **Zod**. Reasoning goes in the
  `notes` field (we chose JSON over YAML, so no inline comments).
- License is **Apache-2.0**; keep the AS-IS / disclaimer posture intact.
- Charting is **Recharts**; the lin/semi-log y-axis toggle is a pedagogical
  feature, not optional polish.
- Conventional commits. Each commit should typecheck and pass tests.

## Build order

Follow the phases in handoff §13 — engine + tests before UI. Current state:
Phase 2 done — `engine/dosing.ts` (`concentrationCurve` superposition over
`singleDoseConcentration`, plus the `recurringDoses` schedule builder) and
`engine/pk.ts` closed forms (`timeToPeak`, `singleDoseAuc`, `clearance`,
`accumulationRatio`, `cavgSteadyState`, `steadyStateIvBolus`), with the §10
superposition and steady-state oracle tests. Phase 1 before it:
`engine/models.ts` single-dose models (`iv_bolus`, `oral` incl. the `ka≈ke`
flip-flop limit, `iv_infusion`). Next: Phase 3 (data layer) — `data/schema.ts`
+ Zod validation, `loader.ts`, `derive.ts` (raw compound → `PkParams` + a
derived-list), and 3–5 seed compounds.

**Carry forward into Phase 3/4:** superposition is gated on linearity by
*documentation only* — the engine is pure and deliberately has no `linear`
flag. The actual `linear: false → refuse/disable superposition` enforcement is
not yet in code; it must land in the loader/derive layer (Phase 3) or the UI
(Phase 4), or it silently never happens.

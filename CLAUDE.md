# Pharmacographer — project guide for Claude Code

Interactive, **educational** pharmacokinetics (PK) curve plotter. The product is
**epistemic honesty**, not a prettier chart. Read
`PHARMACOGRAPHER_HANDOFF.md` for the full plan; this file is the working
conventions and the things that are easy to get wrong.

## The bright line (non-negotiable)

**Educational, never clinical.** Never build a feature that takes individual
patient data (real weight, renal/hepatic function, age, genetics) and returns a
dose or a clinical decision. Plotting an illustrative curve for a dose the user
picked is education; returning "give this patient X mg" is a medical device — do
not build it, however it is requested. The persistent `DisclaimerBanner` stays
wired in and non-dismissible.

## Architecture — three layers, hard boundaries (handoff §4)

```
engine/  pure PK math. NO React, NO DOM, NO data/JSON imports, NO I/O.
data/    one JSON file per compound + Zod schema + loader + derivation layer.
ui/      React components. The only layer that imports data and engine.
```

- The **engine is pure**: parameters + schedule in → concentration array out. It
  knows nothing about drugs, files, or pixels. `tsconfig.app.json` sets
  `types: []` and `eslint.config.js` strips globals under `src/engine/**` to
  enforce this — keep it that way.
- Dependencies point **upward only**: ui → data → engine. Never the reverse.

## Units — convert only at the edges (handoff §6)

One canonical internal system: **mg, L, mg/L, h, 1/h, L/h, mg/h**. All conversion
factors live in `src/engine/units.ts` — never scatter literals. Vd from sources
is usually L/kg; scale to absolute L with the **70 kg illustrative reference
subject** (`REFERENCE_WEIGHT_KG`). That subject is an educational assumption, not
a patient weight — never frame it otherwise.

## Data + provenance rules (handoff §3, §8)

- Every numeric parameter carries `value` (+ optional `range`) `+ unit + derived
(bool) + sourceRef + conditions`. `sourceRef` must resolve to a key in
  `sources` (or a sentinel like `definition` / `derived_from_tmax`).
- `derived: true` → the UI marks that value computed. Unavailable route → UI
  marks the line "inferred, not measured". Never invent a citation.
- `linear: false` compounds (nonlinear PK: phenytoin, ethanol, high-dose
  salicylate) are **excluded from v1** — superposition is invalid for them.
- Prefer FDA Structured Product Labels (public domain, openFDA). Don't lift
  curated tables wholesale; re-derive from primary sources. Record curator
  reasoning in the compound's `notes`. See `docs/DATA_GUIDE.md`.

## Testing (handoff §10)

Engine correctness is proven against **closed-form analytic answers**, not golden
snapshots: e.g. IV bolus `C(0)=D/Vd`, `C(t½)=C(0)/2`; numeric AUC ≈ `D/(Vd·ke)`;
flip-flop `ka≈ke` branch returns finite values; superposition of one dose equals
the single-dose curve. Numeric AUC via trapezoid on a fine grid, assert within a
small relative tolerance. Write the test before/with the math and make it pass.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev            # dev server
npm test               # vitest run (engine oracle tests)
npm run test:watch     # vitest watch
npm run build          # tsc -b + vite build (typecheck gate)
npm run lint           # eslint
npm run format         # prettier --write
```

Before committing a change: `npm test`, `npm run lint`, `npm run build` should
all pass.

## Conventions

- Tests import from `vitest` explicitly (globals are off).
- Data files are **JSON**, validated at load with **Zod**. Reasoning goes in the
  `notes` field (we chose JSON over YAML, so no inline comments).
- License is **Apache-2.0**; keep the AS-IS / disclaimer posture intact.
- Charting is **Recharts**; the lin/semi-log y-axis toggle is a pedagogical
  feature, not optional polish.
- Conventional commits. Each commit should typecheck and pass tests.

## Build order

Follow the phases in handoff §13 — engine + tests before UI. Current state:
**Phase 4 done** (minimum UI) — `ui/curve.ts` is the engine↔data glue
(`routeOptions`/`defaultRoute`, `buildCurve`: `deriveParams` → inject infusion
duration → single-dose schedule → auto-sized time grid → `concentrationCurve`).
`ui/App.tsx` owns state and resets the route to the compound's default on every
compound switch (so an oral-only → iv-only change can't strand a non-derivable
route). Components: `CompoundPicker`, `RouteDoseControls` (disables routes the
engine can't plot), `ConcentrationChart` (Recharts; owns the lin/semi-log
y-toggle; log axis pins the domain to the smallest positive value so `log(0)`
can't blank the chart). Earlier phases: Phase 3 data layer (`data/schema.ts` Zod
validation, `loader.ts`, `derive.ts` with the linearity gate, 3 FDA-sourced seed
compounds); Phases 1–2 engine (`models.ts`, `dosing.ts`, `pk.ts`) with the §10
oracle tests. Next: **Phase 5 (honesty UI)** — `ProvenancePanel` (sources +
conditions), `ModelAssumptionsNote`, measured-vs-derived flags, and the
"inferred, not measured" warning surfaced properly (App already passes the
`deriveParams` warnings through a light strip; Phase 5 makes it first-class).

**Linearity gate — landed (Phase 3).** Superposition is valid only for linear
PK. The engine stays pure with no `linear` flag; the gate lives in
`data/derive.ts`, where `deriveParams` throws for a `linear: false` (or
non-one-compartment) compound rather than feeding the engine parameters it would
misuse. The UI catches that throw and shows the message instead of a curve.

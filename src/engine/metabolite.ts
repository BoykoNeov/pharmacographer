/**
 * Parent → metabolite kinetics (handoff §12 extension; metabolites spike, then
 * the multi-compartment generalisation).
 *
 * A fraction `fm` of what the parent eliminates forms the metabolite, which then
 * clears with its own one-compartment disposition (`Vd_m`, `k_m`). The parent's
 * central concentration is a sum of exponential MODES (`Σ coef_λ·e^(−λ·t)`) — one
 * mode for a one-compartment parent, two for a two-compartment IV-bolus parent
 * (α, β). The metabolite amount then solves, mode by mode, to a Bateman term:
 *
 *   dA_m/dt = fm·k10·A_central − k_m·A_m,   A_m(0) = 0
 *
 * where the formation flux `fm·k10·A_central = fm·CL·Σ coef_λ·e^(−λ·t)` (because
 * `k10·Vc = CL`). So each parent mode contributes
 *
 *   A_m,λ(t) = batemanMode(fm·CL·coef_λ, λ, k_m, t)
 *   C_m(t)   = (1/Vd_m)·Σ_λ A_m,λ(t)
 *
 * The KEY subtlety of the multi-compartment case: the input AMPLITUDE carries the
 * clearance `CL` (via `k10`), while the exponent and denominator carry the mode
 * rate `λ` (α or β). These coincide only in one compartment (where the parent
 * decays at the same rate `ke` it eliminates), which is why the one-compartment
 * function below is exactly the single-mode specialisation.
 *
 * `batemanMode` shares `models.ts`'s `FLIP_FLOP_REL_TOL` guard for its `λ ≈ k_m`
 * (formation ≈ elimination) 0/0 degeneracy. Because the whole parent+metabolite
 * system is linear, superposition over a dose schedule stays valid (same
 * mechanism as `dosing.ts`).
 *
 * Formation- vs elimination-rate-limited behaviour is NOT special-cased: the
 * terminal slope is `−min(slowest parent rate, k_m)`, which falls out of the
 * Bateman form.
 *
 * ORAL PARENT (the residue-form generalisation): an oral parent's central
 * concentration is not a plain sum of `coef·e^(−λt)` modes — it is a sum of Bateman
 * terms `Σ_λ B_λ·(e^(−ka·t) − e^(−λ·t))` (first-order absorption convolved with the
 * disposition). Collecting the exponentials rewrites it in RESIDUE form as a plain
 * mode sum over `{ka, λ…}`: one mode at rate `ka` with coefficient `Σ_λ B_λ`, and one
 * mode per disposition rate λ with coefficient `−B_λ`, where `B_λ = ka·F·D·g_λ/(λ−ka)`.
 * Those modes then feed the SAME {@link metaboliteConcentrationFromModes} core the IV
 * cases use, so one function serves a 1-, 2- or 3-compartment oral parent. Its total
 * exposure is `AUC_m = fm·F·D/(k_m·Vd_m)` (the CL and the `(λ−ka)` factors all cancel —
 * only the absorbed fraction F reaches the metabolite), the free regression anchor.
 * The `B_λ` denominator has a removable pole at `ka = λ`; the residue split cannot
 * represent that double pole (it would need a `t·e^(−λt)` limit term), so the builder
 * REFUSES a coincident absorption/disposition rate rather than emit a wrong curve —
 * the same refuse-don't-mislead posture as the linearity gate. This does not arise for
 * physically separated absorption and disposition rates.
 *
 * IV-INFUSION PARENT (the zero-order-input generalisation): an infused parent's
 * central concentration is not a plain mode sum either — it is a rectangular window
 * of zero-order input convolved with the disposition. Since the whole parent →
 * metabolite chain is linear and time-invariant, the metabolite of an infusion is
 * the SAME convolution of that rectangular window with the metabolite's unit-bolus
 * impulse response `h(t) = (1/Vd_m)·Σ_λ batemanMode(fm·CL·g_λ, λ, k_m, t)`. So the
 * metabolite of a single infusion (rate `R0 = D/T` over `[0, T]`) is a difference of
 * running Bateman areas — one closed form covering during and after the infusion with
 * no seam bookkeeping:
 *
 *   C_m(t) = (R0/Vd_m)·Σ_λ [ batemanModeIntegral(fm·CL·g_λ, λ, k_m, t)
 *                           − batemanModeIntegral(fm·CL·g_λ, λ, k_m, max(0, t − T)) ]
 *
 * Its total exposure is `AUC_m = fm·D/(k_m·Vd_m)` — the SAME as the IV bolus (route-
 * and duration-independent; `Σ g_λ/λ = 1/CL` cancels the disposition), the free
 * regression anchor — and as `T → 0` it collapses to the IV-bolus metabolite. This
 * serves a 1-, 2- or 3-compartment infused parent off the same disposition modes.
 *
 * Pre-systemic/first-pass formation is still deferred (this treats the metabolite as
 * formed only from the systemically-absorbed parent).
 *
 * No React, no DOM, no data/JSON imports, no I/O — see CLAUDE.md / handoff §4.
